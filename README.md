Sonos Music Services Browser
============================

This is a proof of concept I created for a personal, home control app. Sharing the code to anyone who could use it.

It basically allows you to browse through all of the music services of a Sonos system. (Including Pandora)

Please note it will only work on music services which have all ready been set-up via the official Sonos app.

Clicking on a song will automatically play the track on the first Sonos speaker found through automatic discovery.

Some code reused from Nathan Borrors excelent Play app here: https://github.com/nathanborror/Play

This project is dead. No further contributions are expected.
